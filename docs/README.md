# Shopper Location

This app attempts to determine the user's location if not already known, first by requesting permission to use their browser's geolocation feature, then by looking up their location based on their IP address as a fallback. The location is stored in the `shippingData` section of the `orderForm` and can then be used by other apps, such as [Location Availability](https://github.com/vtex-apps/location-availability).

A block is also provided which renders a form allowing the user to manually change their location.

:warning: You must have an API key for https://ip-geolocation.whoisxmlapi.com in order to use the IP lookup fallback method.

## Configuration

1. [Install](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/store/installing-an-app) `vtex.shopper-location` in the desired account.

2. In your account's admin dashboard, go to `Apps > My Apps` and click the Settings button for Shopper Location.

3. Enter your API key for https://ip-geolocation.whoisxmlapi.com in the provided field and click Save.

4. Modify your `store-theme` as follows:

- Add the following as dependencies in your theme's manifest if not already present:

```json
    "vtex.store-components": "3.x",
    "vtex.modal-layout": "0.x",
    "vtex.shopper-location": "0.x"
```

- In one of the JSON files in your theme's `store` folder, define the `shopper-location` block and its children, adjusting the props as needed:

```json
"shopper-location": {
    "children": ["modal-trigger#address"]
  },
  "modal-trigger#address": {
    "children": ["user-address", "modal-layout#address"]
  },
  "user-address": {
    "props": {
      "variation": "bar",
      "showStreet": false,
      "showCityAndState": true,
      "showPostalCode": true,
      "showPrefix": false,
      "showIfEmpty": true
    }
  },
  "modal-layout#address": {
    "children": ["modal-header#address", "modal-content#address"]
  },
  "modal-header#address": {
    "children": ["flex-layout.col#address-header"]
  },
  "flex-layout.col#address-header": {
    "children": ["rich-text#address-header"],
    "props": {
      "paddingLeft": 5
    }
  },
  "rich-text#address-header": {
    "props": {
      "text": "### Change Location"
    }
  },
  "modal-content#address": {
    "children": ["change-location"]
  },
```

- Also in one of the JSON files, place the `shopper-location` block in your layout. For example, to place the block in the header:

```json
"flex-layout.row#header-desktop": {
    "props": {
      "blockClass": "main-header",
      "horizontalAlign": "center",
      "verticalAlign": "center",
      "preventHorizontalStretch": true,
      "preventVerticalStretch": true,
      "fullWidth": true
    },
    "children": [
      "flex-layout.col#logo-desktop",
      "flex-layout.col#category-menu",
      "flex-layout.col#spacer",
      "shopper-location",
      "search-bar",
      "locale-switcher",
      "login",
      "minicart.v2"
    ]
  },
```

## Customization
